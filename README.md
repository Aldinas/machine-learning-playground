# Overview
This repo contains most of my learnings and experiments regarding Machine Learning and Unity 3D. 
The projects I work on and add to here will also be documented on my blog here: http://www.closedonsundays.co.uk/index.php/blog/

## Getting Started
Each folder (bar the Python one) is a Unity project in its own right, however to cut down on size I've not comitted some asset store packages.
In most cases the missing files are part of the TensorflowSharp Unity Plugin package (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Using-TensorFlow-Sharp-in-Unity.md)
and will just need to be downloaded and installed from that link.

Some packages may also require ProCore's ProBuilder asset pack from the asset store, but I will try to mention this where required.

You will need to make sure you have Python 3.x or higher on your machine as well as .NET framework 4.6.
